# AdminJS Deno template

A starter project to build an AdminJS app running on Deno.

## Get started

The current implementation of AdminJS needs a minor workaround:

```sh
deno task setup
```

Then, define your settings on the `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, start the server with:

```sh
deno task dev
```
